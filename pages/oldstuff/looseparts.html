      <img src="../../assets/loose/mobo.jpg" alt="An image of an old motherboard." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-1: Here is an old motherboard I have in storage. It still has BIOS equipped instead of UEFI. I'm not sure what its form factor is, but if I had to guess, it would be a Mini-ATX or an ITX.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/grammobo.jpg" alt="An image of an even older motherboard." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-2: Here is my great-grandmother's motherboard. It was extracted from a <a href="./looseparts.html#rustycase">case that started rusting</a> a dangerous amount. Despite the hell that the case has gone through, the motherboard is in great condition.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/hdds.jpg" alt="An image of two old HDDs (Hard Disk Drives)." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-3: Here are two loose HDDs. The one on the left has 80GB, but I'm not sure about the one on the right.</figcaption>
    </figure>

      <img src="../../assets/loose/soundblaster.jpg" alt="An old SoundBlaster-16 PCI adapter card." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-4: A SoundBlaster-16 PCI adapter card.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/landlinecard.jpg" alt="An old landline internet PCI adapter card." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-5: A landline PCI adapter card. Of course, I can't really use this. Landline is not common at all anymore.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/serialcard.jpg" alt="An old serial PCI adapter card." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-6: I may be wrong, but I believe this is a serial PCI adapter card. This port was used for peripheral devices, or mice/keyboards that used this port over the PS/2 ports.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/usbcard.jpg" alt="A USB PCI adapter card." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-7: A USB 2.0 PCI adapter card.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/psu.jpg" alt="The backside of an old Power Supply Unit." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-8: This is an old PSU. It has a selector for two different voltage types, which typically depends on the region you're in (yes, different places in the world provide different amounts of voltage to your appliances). The one I am holding right now does not work.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/psucord.jpg" alt="The same PSU as before, with its cord(s) extended." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-9: Here is the same PSU. This image shows the cords provided by the unit. As you can probablly see, it also provides floppy support.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/hugespeaker.jpg" alt="An image of a relatively large PC speaker." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-10: Here is a large PC speaker that was apart of my great-grandmother's PC case. Later PC speakers would become much smaller, and then would not be used anymore.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/largefloppies.jpg" alt="An image of a large floppy disk, as well as a similarlly sized box with several more." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-11: Here are the large floppy disks I gave you. I kept three for myself in the case I could find a way to use them.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure id="rustycase">
      <img src="../../assets/loose/rustycase.jpg" alt="An old rusting case with some non-dedicated de-rusting tools adjacent to it." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-12: Here is my great-grandmother's rapidly rusting PC case. I unfortunately had to throw this case out, but I kept the components from within. They were in surprisingly good condition.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/wasteland.jpg" alt="Several dead PSUs in a corner." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-13: PSU wasteland.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../assets/loose/cat.jpg" alt="An angry gray cat interfering with the workspace photography." />
      <figcaption>Fig. 1-14: My cat wants her breakfast at 4:00 AM. Yelling and jumping onto the nearest object seems to give that message the most efficiently.</figcaption>
