      Welcome to my website! I talk about and show off a lot of computer-related things in this website, so feel free to explore.<br />
      I recommend that you explore this website via the hyperlinks on the header.

    <h3>Coverings on this website</h3>
    <p>On this website, I've provided some games I've made in mostly JavaScript along with some information about myself and what old computer relics and projects I have.</p>
    <p>All of these things can be found via the navigation bar at the top.</p>
    <p>"Things I've helped with" is a list of problems people students who came to me for a solution have had encountered when programming their page. I suggest that you take a look at that page when you can. However, there is no need to prioritize it.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>My Programming History</h3>
    <p>I've been programming since I was 9, starting in something much more basic and modern, like Scratch for example.</p>
    <p>I would be connecting blocks to make neat and obsolete projects in many different but similar programs, in which I had discovered a very underrated website called <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html" target="_blank"><i>Snap!</i></a>, which is essentially a Scratch clone, but it provides lots of more technological features such as compatibility with peripheral devices and JavaScript features.</p>
    <p>I never was a huge fan of the block-programming, I quickly moved on from it, and now I've never used it in years.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The first "programming" language I learnt was Batch, the Command Prompt scripting language. I was 10 at the time. I hadn't known this yet, but it was simply a scripting language. Regardless, I was happy that I could now make words do things on a computer rather than blocks. I also ridded my fear of the "hacker box" (Command Prompt window).</p>
    <br />
    <p>After that, I wondered how I could make more visual things, as Batch was running on Command Prompt, a completely text-based program. My next language would be HTML, which I would learn when I was 11.</p>
    <p>This was quite comedic, as HTML isn't <i>directly</i> programming either. Despite this, what I would learn from understanding HTML would provide me with visual results, which is what I wanted in the first place, so learning this language did work out for me after all.</p>
    <p>In the process, I learned some basic JavaScript and CSS to assist in the creation of my pages. It wasn't anything revolutionary, but learning this would light the path of programming syntax in the future.</p>
    <p>When I had discovered JavaScript, I had recognized the syntax from stock images I looked at trying my hardest to understand when I was 9. Yes, I did that. Five years ago, I searched up "coding", looked at images, and would spend almost hours trying to comprehend it. Evidently, I was not given directions for my research.</p>
    <br />
    <p>During this self-education, I had exponentially grown an interest for programming in its entirety. At 12, I would start learning some about Python, and a plentiful amount about Lua (which would then be used in Roblox and Garry's Mod).</p>
    <p>My self-teachings of Lua had led me to create a Garry's Mod <a href="./assets/fad.png">fad</a> addon, being released on September 30th, 2024, and being noticed on October 4th of the same year (due to that day being a friday, I suppose all the children decided it was a good time to start their weekend addon scrolling). I will not provide the link to the project, as it is a Garry's Mod addon, Garry's Mod being a modification of Half-Life 2, the Half-Life games being  gun games.</p>
    <br />
    <p>At 13, I would learn so much about Java, which I had used and loved very much. I still program with it today, making games and utilities, most of them visual with Java's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)" target="_blank">Swing library</a>.</p>
    <p>At this time, I would also find out that some past friends I still was virtually in contact with had created a development team on Roblox, due to them inviting me to be apart of it. I was impressed to see them as dedicated as I was to making pixels change colours on a screen, indirectly sending dopamine to the user. In record time, I was very disappointed when I found that I was really the only one working, while the rest of the "team" had slacked off making empty, edgy, innapropriate jokes, while doing a less-than-half effort at modelling. Yes, all of them only knew how to make things in Blender &mdash; which is impressive, but that's really all they did. I would do the rest of the work, taking up the majority of my weekend for something that would hopefully suffice their expectations. You can probably tell by my wording that I do not affiliate with them anymore.</p>
    <br />
    <p>At my age now, I would learn even more about Java, continuing its use, as well as some more complex JavaScript, in which I hope paid off well here.</p>
    <p>This year is my first year attending a form of education dedicated to programming. This excites me very much as I've always been self-taught, and I am very enthusiastic about what I can learn from another prespective &mdash; a more experienced prespective.</p>
    <p>In other words, I am prepared to learn more about computer hardware and HTML this semester, and I will always be picking up what you're putting down (when possible); even if my results may be a <i>little</i> late.</p>
